                    <p>The Amayzin Grace Foundation Intl Inc. was established by Grace Cece Ofosu, a compassionate
                        and
                        talented teacher, with the aim of creating a brighter future for the vulnerable, poor, and
                        less-privileged individuals, particularly orphans and those who have been abused. Grace, the
                        founder, was born in Ghana and raised in the United States, where she witnessed firsthand
                        the
                        challenges faced by orphans, abused individuals, and the less-privileged in accessing basic
                        necessities such as food, education, and healthcare.

                    <p>Determined to make a difference, Grace is committed to partnering with philanthropists and

                        to bring attention to the needs of neglected individuals, especially orphans and vulnerable
                        children. She firmly believes that through collaborative efforts with donors, opportunities
                        can
                        be created to provide basic education, shelter, and healthcare support to those in need,

                        potential growth of future doctors and otherÂ professionals.</p>
